```

Model
Product.kt → Data class representing product information coming from the FakeStore API.

View (UI)
MainActivity.kt → The main screen displaying the product list.
ProductAdapter.kt → Binds each product card to be displayed in the RecyclerView.
XML files (activity_main.xml, item_product.xml) → Visual definitions of UI components.

ViewModel
ProductViewModel.kt → Manages data coming from the API, uses LiveData to update the UI.

Repository

ProductRepository.kt → Handles data flow between the ViewModel and the API, executes Retrofit calls.
This structure ensures loose coupling between Model and View components and increases testability.


Technologies Used

Retrofit
Description: A library developed by Square to simplify HTTP requests.

Usage:

In RetrofitInstance.kt, we define BASE_URL = "https://fakestoreapi.com/".
In ProductApi.kt, we specify endpoints such as @GET("products").
In ProductRepository.kt, this API is called to fetch data and provide it to the ViewModel.



Glide
Description: A library for image loading and caching.

Usage:

In ProductAdapter.kt, use Glide.with(context).load(url).into(imageView) to download product images into an ImageView.
Reduces performance issues and repeated downloads.



RecyclerView
Description: An Android component for efficiently displaying lists or grids.

Usage:

In MainActivity.kt, set up a vertical list with LinearLayoutManager.
In ProductAdapter.kt, manage data binding and ViewHolder logic.

ViewBinding
Description: A mechanism that makes views defined in XML safer and more accessible.

Usage:

In build.gradle, enable buildFeatures { viewBinding = true }.
In MainActivity.kt and adapter files, use inflate(...) to create binding objects (e.g., ItemProductBinding).

Coroutines
Description: A Kotlin library that simplifies asynchronous (or concurrent) operations.

Usage:

In ProductViewModel.kt, network requests are executed in the background using viewModelScope.launch { ... }.
Repository functions can be marked as suspend, allowing Retrofit calls to be made without blocking the UI thread.

Advantages:

Data fetching occurs without blocking the main (UI) thread.
Error handling with try/catch becomes more readable and straightforward.





How It Works?

When the App Launches:
MainActivity (View) requests data from ProductViewModel.

ViewModel:
The fetchProducts() method initiates an API call via ProductRepository.

Repository:
Calls RetrofitInstance.api.getProducts() to retrieve the JSON response from the FakeStore API and convert it into a Product list.

When Data Arrives:
The ViewModel updates LiveData<List<Product>>.
Since MainActivity observes this list, it automatically updates and provides the new list to the RecyclerView adapter.

On the Screen:
ProductAdapter uses the item_product.xml layout for each product item, downloads images with Glide, and assigns values to components like TextView.
Thus, the user sees the product list (images, names, prices, descriptions) on the main screen.


UI Observability

The data in the ViewModel is observed using LiveData.
MainActivity (or other UI components) automatically updates when changes in LiveData are observed.
This mechanism makes the UI reactive; it updates automatically as the data changes (for example, during screen rotations).


Error Handling

In the Repository layer, errors during network requests are caught using try/catch blocks or by checking Response.isSuccessful.
Error messages are passed to the UI via LiveData<String> or similar variables in the ViewModel.
MainActivity observes these error messages and can notify the user through a Toast, Dialog, or other means.
This approach ensures that the app handles errors gracefully without crashing.


Summary


In this project, I utilized Retrofit, Glide, RecyclerView, ViewBinding, and Coroutines following the MVVM principles.
MVVM ensures separation of concerns: the Model (data) and View (UI) layers are loosely coupled.
Coroutines enable seamless asynchronous network requests without blocking the UI.
ViewModel and LiveData achieve UI observability, ensuring the interface updates automatically as data changes (e.g., during screen rotations).
Error handling is managed in the Repository or ViewModel, with error messages observed by the UI and communicated to the user.
In terms of scalability, additional data sources, offline caching, or new features can be integrated easily.
